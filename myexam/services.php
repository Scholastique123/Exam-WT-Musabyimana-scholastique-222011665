    <h2>Capture Device:</h2>
    <p>
    The process begins with a capture device, such as a digital camera or camcorder, which records visual information as video footage. These devices may vary in features, capabilities, and quality depending on the intended use and budget.

    <h2>Recording Medium:</h2>
    <p>
     The captured video is usually stored on a recording medium, such as internal memory, a memory card, a hard drive, or a tape (though less common now). This medium stores the digital data representing the video footage until it's transferred or edited.
</p>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Data Transfer and Storage: </h2>
    <p>
     If the video needs to be moved to another device or edited on a computer, it's typically transferred from the recording medium to a computer or external storage device. This transfer can be done via various methods such as USB, Wi-Fi, or memory card readers.</p>
